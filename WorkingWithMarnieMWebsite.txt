MarnieM Site
Locally:
  on phpMyAdmin create new database:
     MarnieM using utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci encoding
   
  create Table with:
     IDCode	Name	ImgFilePath	ImgFilename	Medium	Style	Theme	Caption	Comments	Keywords	StartDate	FinishDate	Height	Width	Depth	Weight	Price	Location	History	Exhibited	Frame	Other

  create two sample entries
  
Online
  Database name:  reaie502_MarnieM
  Table name:     Catalog

----------------------------------------------------------------------  
  
Setting up database on WHC site:

log onto local PHPMyAdmin
select MarnieM database
choose Export from buttons on top
   Export method: Quick
   Format: SQL
   Go
 creates MarnieM.sql on desktop

 go to WHC cPanel:
  	http://reaie502.mywhc.ca/cpanel
Username: 	reaie502
Password: 	v1TSFg!H3as(54
 
launch phpMyAdmin from Cpanel
go to reaie502_MarnieM database
import:
   select marniem.sql from desktop
   hit Go
   
   get error: #1273 - Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci'
   so in marniem.sql replace all of those with utf8_general_ci
   
   new error:
   #1253 - COLLATION 'utf8_general_ci' is not valid for CHARACTER SET 'utf8mb4'
   
   in marniem.sql change: from utf8mb4 to utf8mb3 everywhere
   
   success!
   
   New database login stuff:
   
<?php // 5_mySQLogin
$db_hostname = 'localhost';  
$db_database = 'reaie502_MarnieM';
$db_username = 'reaie502'; //'DougRRogers';
$db_password = 'v1TSFg!H3as(54'; //'DRR(Msq)1!';
   
   NOTE: WHC site is case sensitive, so "Catalog" had to be changed to "catalog" in all DB references in source code

  Transfer local activity to Blue ASUS:
  1) Install Apache 2.4.18 Win64
  2) Install PHP 7 (PHP 7.0.5) VC14 x64 Thread Safe
  3) Install MySQL 5.5 (mysql-5.5.47-winx64.msi   from MariaDB)
      OLD Password:  MSQLPW_NTOM
      Password:  MSQL_DYZARENTR <<<<=====  Use THIS at MySQL Prompt!

      Username: DRR
        Host:   <all Hosts>
        Role:   DB Manager
        Authentication: MySQL
        Password: DYZA_R_ENTR  ( OLD Password: NTOM_DRR )
      
      Windows Service Name:  MySQL  ( OLD Windows Service Name:  MySQL_NTOM )

      After MySQL is installed...

      Run "MySQL 5.6 Command Line Client"
        Password is MSQL_DYZARENTR, produces  mysql> prompt
 
  
   Create new PSN specific user:
      GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'drrogers_DRRPSN'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YE_wit@15-12';
      
   On Arvixe site add same user/pwd with all privileges
   
   Remotely:
     download PSN database (export), move to YE/PSN as 
        drrogers_PSN_16-04-08.sql
        
   Locally (at MSQL command prompt):
   load the database with:
            source 'D:/Doug/YE/05-PSN/DB Stuff/drrogers_PSN_16-04-08.sql';
   
   DIDN'T WORK because:
     1) Need to set database first, with    use drrogers_PSN;
     
     2) Type “source path-to-SQL-file“. BUT, you must follow these rules:
        - Use the full source command, not the \. shortcut
        - Have no spaces in your path. I copied mine to a root of a drive. Note that spaces in the file name is OK, just not the path.
        - Do not quote the file name, even if it has spaces. This gave error 22.
        - Use forward slashes in the path, e.g., C:/path/to/filename.sql. Otherwise you’ll get error 2.
        (- Do not end with a semicolon.)
        
    So this worked: 
      source D:/Doug/YE/05-PSN/DBStuff/drrogers_PSN_16-04-08.sql;   
      
      
      
Try to run PSN locally, get this:
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'mysqli' not found in D:\Doug\ApacheDocRoot\PSN\PSNSim.php:39 Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in D:\Doug\ApacheDocRoot\PSN\PSNSim.php on line 39

Probably because mysql is not set up in php.ini

  in php.ini, need to uncomment  ;extension=php_mysqli.dll

Arrivx database:

name: drrogers_PSN

new User:  drrogers_DRR
pwd:  YE_wit@15-12

Create new local database with:
create database drrogers_PSN;

followed by:
source 'D:/YE/05-PSN/DB Stuff/PSN_DB_15-12-16.sql';

Then created new user with new password:
mysql> CREATE USER 'drrogers_DRR'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YE_wit@15-12';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.28 sec)

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO 'drrogers_DRR'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)


New user name and password:  16-04-08
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'drrogers_DRRPSN'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YE_wit@15-12';

  



15-12-20:
   Upgrade local version of php to :
php-5.4.45-Win32-VC9-x86.zip

   This is so I'm using a newer version than the AppZ version, 
   and so I can use xDebug to enable profiling. This only works
   with php 5.4.45 or later.  Also, this makes it compatible with
   the Arivx site.
   
  Unzip php package, put php folder in Program Files
use php.ini[inUse]-development  for php.ini  


php.ini development vs. production
   After standard installation, php configuration file /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini 
   is set so as "production settings" which means, among others, that no error 
   messages are displayed. So if you e.g. make a syntax error in your php source 
   file, apache server would return HTTP 500 error instead of displaying 
   the php syntax error debug message.
   If you want to debug your scripts, it might be better to use the "development" 
   settings. 

NOTE:  In php.ini  be sure to uncomment this:
extension=php_mysqli.dll

   
   
xDebug:
php_xdebug-2.4.0rc3-5.4-vc9.dll

    Download php_xdebug-2.4.0rc3-5.4-vc9.dll
    Move the downloaded file to C:\php
    Create php.ini in the same folder as where php.exe is and add the line
    zend_extension = C:\php\php_xdebug-2.4.0rc3-5.4-vc9.dll
    Restart the webserver

DONE:     zend_extension = C:\php\php_xdebug-2.4.0rc3-5.4-vc9.dll
  ( in both dev and production versions)   

Starting The Profiler

Profiling is enabled by setting the xdebug.profiler_enable setting to 1 in php.ini. 
This instructs Xdebug to start writing profiling information into the dump directory 
configured with the xdebug.profiler_output_dir directive. The name of the generated 
file always starts with "cachegrind.out." and ends with either the PID (process ID) 
of the PHP (or Apache) process or the crc32 hash of the directory containing the 
initially debugged script. Make sure you have enough space in your 
xdebug.profiler_output_dir as the amount of information generated by the 
profiler can be enormous for complex scripts, for example up to 500MB for 
a complex application like eZ Publish.

You can also selectively enable the profiler with the xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger 
setting set to 1. If it is set to 1, then you can enable the profiler by using 
a GET/POST or COOKIE variable of the name XDEBUG_PROFILE. The FireFox 2 extension 
that can be used to enable the debugger (see HTTP Debug Sessions) can also be 
used with this setting. In order for the trigger to work properly, 
xdebug.profiler_enable needs to be set to 0.


For Viewing xDebug output, use QCacheGrind - executable from downloaded package3

D
Domains: Domain Transfer

I want to transfer my website and domain to Web Hosting Canada

R
Ramakrishna joined

R
Hello, Douglas. I'm Ramakrishna. Welcome to Chat Support. I will help you with the website and domain concerns

Please provide the 'Support Code' in your Billing Panel to authenticate the account. 

D
where do I find the support code?  If I go back to the billing panel I will lose this chat session

R
Please access the link for support code: 'https://customers.arvixe.com/clientarea.php' 

Please copy the link and paste it into new tab

D
298839-139844

R
 Thank you for the authentication code. 

I have located your account. 

Could you please elaborate on your query more specifically, so that I can help you in the best way possible? 

D
I've tried to follow the steps to transfer my domain.  I had unlocked the domain, I got the EPP key and sent it to WHC.  But when I checked my WhoIs I see that the domain is still locked.  Also, I want to cancel the hosting service (it's already set up at WHC) but I don't want to do it abruptly, I want to make sure it goes smoothly

How do I unlock the domain so that WHC can become the new registrar?

R
Thanks for the detailed information. 

D
I have already downloaded all the files from the Arvixe hosting site, so it can be closed safely, but I want to make sure the domain has been transferred properly before the switch

R
ad1 

I do understand your concern. Don't worry, I will check this for you. 

sorry for the typo

Please allow me 3-4 minutes to check this with our billing admins. 

D
BTW, I had turned off Auto-Renew but discovered it was turned back on. I don't want to be billed (starting early March) for more hosting since I've already setup hosting at WHC.

R
 Meanwhile, Please fill this cancelation form to cancel the hosting:
https://customers.arvixe.com/clientarea.php?action=cancel&id=331616

D
I've requested the cancellation.  Here's another issue: I'm having trouble changing the contact info for the domain.  I live in Canada now.  I tried changing it but it's still got my Hodor Court address in the US

R
No worries! I could see that the domain is already released and EPP code has been sent to you

The domain can now definitely be transferred.

The hosting will expire on 10 Mar, 2021

Do you wish to cancel the hosting after the expiry date?

D
yes. I want to cancel the hosting since I've set up hosting at WHC.

R
No worries! The hosting will be cancelled automatically after the hosting expiry date

D
When I did a WHOIS search it indicated the domain is still locked:

Registry Domain ID: D54679309-LRMS
Domain Status:
clientTransferProhibited
serverTransferProhibited

That was about 30 min ago.  Perhaps it's fully unlocked now and WHC can take over as registrar?

R
Yes! The domain is currently with 1API GmbH company

MySQL Database

14-04-19:

First, export the current NTOM database, using the DOS command prompt:
mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM yowzae73_NTOM > c:\yowzae73_NTOM_DB_14-04-19.sql

then use 7-zip to create a gz file:
c:\yowzae73_NTOM_DB_14-04-19.sql.gz

Then, on NTOM.vn, create a database:

Your database has been setup. Use the following values:
	Database:	ntomvn_NTOM
	Host:	localhost
	Username:	ntomvn_DRR
	Password:	DRR_nt_02

Then, upload c:\yowzae73_NTOM_DB_14-04-19.sql.gz

Success: Database has been successfully Restored

--------------------------------------------
Next, at ntom.vn  home, go to Manage MySQL,
Click on phpMyAdmin

===================================================================================
Creating Backups (going into C:\ base directory)

EXECUTE FROM WINDOWS COMMMAND PROMPT, not MySQL prompt!
(Note: c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin is in Windows Path, so no need to enter)

[c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin\]   
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM > c:\NTOM_DB_13-10-22(PreNewCNLSystem).sql  
13-10-24, backup of intermediate work on CN update:
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM > c:\NTOM_DB_13-10-24(MixOfCNUpdate_NotGood).sql
13-10-26, backup of files used for CatNav update, before cleanup:	
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM > c:\NTOM_DB_13-10-26(PostCNUpdate_PreCleanup).sql
13-10-28, backup of files used for CatNav update, before cleanup:	
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM > c:\NTOM_DB_13-10-28(PostCNUpdate_PreCleanup).sql
	
13-10-28, Good, post-cleanup backup:	
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM > c:\NTOM_DB_13-10-28(GoodData,Clean,BaselineTables).sql
	
	
To backup a single table, use:
[c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin\]   
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM ye_items > C:\NTOM_DB__YE_ITEMS__13-10-22(PreCNUpdate).sql


You can load the dump file back into the server like this:

shell> mysql db_name < backup-file.sql
Or like this:

shell> mysql -e "source /path-to-backup/backup-file.sql" db_name

To create CSV files:
[c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin\]
    mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM --no-create-info --tab=c:/NTOM_DB_BU_13-11-08 --fields-terminated-by='\t' NTOM


Restoring from a Backup File
To restore a single database, use the -D option followed by the name of the database:
   mysql -u user -ppassword -D publications < publications.sql
   mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM NTOM < c:\NTOM_DB_13_07_27_SHOP_ILS.sql
   
[c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin\]
    mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM -D NTOM < C:\NTOM_DB_13-10-28_NoVietCollation.sql

To restore a single table to a database, use a command such as:
[c:\"Program files"\MySQL\"MySQL Server 5.6"\bin\]
    mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM -D NTOM < C:\NTOM_DB__YE_ITEMS__13-10-12(PreCNUpdate).sql


Create the database:
1)  CREATE DATABASE yowzae73_NTOM CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
create a user:
2) GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'yowzae73_DR'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'DRR_nt_02';

import the NTOM database into the new database:
(At a DOS prompt):
   mysql -u yowzae73_DR -pDRR_nt_02 -D yowzae73_NTOM < C:\NTOM_DB_13-10-28_NoVietCollation.sql

======

===============================================================================================

1) Creating new CatNames_01  spreadsheet, with hiComprCatNavs, bilingual

2) Save as CSV with UTF-8, tab, \r\n

2) Import into NTOM DB with 
mysql> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/Yowza Enterprises/Projects/23-VirtualMarket/2-CatNames_HiCmprCatNav_NewOrdering_GoogTranslate_BEST_14-04-27.csv' INTO TABLE Cat_Names_01FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/2-hicCatNavsAndNames-ECAudio_BL_MinSubCat_V18.csv' INTO TABLE CatNames_01 FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;

==============================================================

shell> mysql db_name < backup-file.sql
Or like this:

shell> mysql -e "source /path-to-backup/backup-file.sql" db_name

mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM -D ntomvn_ntom < D:/ApacheDocRoot/MySQLDataBaseDumps/ntomvn_NTOM_DB_14-05-06-FakeShopsData.sql

==========================================================================================================================
14-05-09:

Uploading new CatNav based database.

1) Using AppVA DirectAdmin tool, download current online database for backup
    ( saved onto desktop as ntomvn_NTOM.gz )


2) save current home database:
mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-09_NewCmprCatNavs.sql

3) Then run 7Zip on saved file to create gz version:
c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-09_NewCmprCatNavs.sql.gz

4) Then delete current database from site:
At Direct Admin, MySQL functions


5) Then create new database:
Your database has been setup. Use the following values:
    Database:	ntomvn_NTOM
    Host:	localhost
    Username:	ntomvn_DRR
    Password:	DRR_nt_02


6) Now upload saved database
At Direct Admin MySQL page, upload 
  c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-09_NewCmprCatNavs.sql.gz
  
After a few minutes, get "Database restored"

7) all website files, imgs_parts, etc. also updated

========================================================================================

14-05-14
Do some MSDB cleanup:
  clear activitylog
  clear bundles
  clear carts
  clear customers
  delete cart_1000,1001,1002
  create views sinf,cinf,actinf,binf
  NOTE: No real shop items added yet
  
Then save MSDB as:
mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-14_CleanABCC_FakeShopsItems_Views.sql  
  

14-05-20
Transitioned to new alphanumeric CatNavs,
catnames_01 has records of old and new values

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-20_NewAlphaNumCN_FakeShopsItems_Views.sql

Then clean up catnames_01:
NewOrderIx => OrderIx
New_Cat_Nav_X => CatNav_X
CatNav_A => CatNav
+ drop the three original (old data) columns

Then save MSDB as:
mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-20_OnlyAlaphNCNs_FakeShopsItems_Views.sql  
  
Because of new part numbering system, all catnames_ DB tables can be renamed with a single digit, so
renamed all tables:
catnames_00 => catnames_0
catnames_01 => catnames_1
...
catnames_08 => catnames_8
 

=================================================================================
14-05-21
Decide to consolidate all catnames into one DB,
1) rename catnames_8 => catnames
2) Create masterlist of all catnames with Electronics, Computers, Audio, Tools
    CatNames_MasterList(AllCats)_14-05-21.csv    (with tabs)
3) import to catnames:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/Yowza Enterprises/Projects/23-VirtualMarket/2-CatNames_HiCmprCatNav_NewOrdering_GoogTranslate_BEST_14-04-27.csv' INTO TABLE Cat_Names_01FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;


LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/NTOM/DataBase Stuff/CatNames_MasterList(AllCats)_14-05-21.csv' INTO TABLE catnames FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;


WHEN LINES ARE SKIPPED - that means dups in the primary key.
Create a table without primary key, load it with same csv
Then do:
   select * from catnames_7 where catnav in (select catnav from catnames_7 group by catnav having count(*) > 1);

   
New, simple CatNames works, so dropped all catnames_ tables

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-21_OneCatnamesWithAlaphNCNs_FakeShopsItems.sql    
Then sent it through 7zip to create
mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-21_OneCatnamesWithAlaphNCNs_FakeShopsItems.sql.gz


   
   
===================================================================================
14-05-22
Delete current database from ntom site:

4) Then delete current database from site:
At Direct Admin, MySQL functions
- in overall structure:
   check all
   drop all
    - didn't work,
    
- instead, delete db from opening screen    
   


5) Then create new database:
Your database has been setup. Use the following values:
    Database:	ntomvn_NTOM
    Host:	localhost
    Username:	ntomvn_DRR
    Password:	DRR_nt_02


6) Now upload saved database
At Direct Admin MySQL page, upload 
  c:\NTOM_DB_14-05-09_NewCmprCatNavs.sql.gz
  
After a few minutes, get "Database restored"

7) all website files, imgs_parts, etc. also updated

All good.  Now it's possible to browse more top categories (Computers, Audio, Tools)

==============================================================
14-06-02
New catnames added for computers and security (very partial)

Master list saved as:
CatNames_MasterList_14-06-02.csv

First, do backup of local NTOM DBs:

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-06-02_BeforeCatNamesUpdate_CompSec.sql

Then delete all lines from current catnames:



Then load new catnames info:
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/NTOM/DataBase Stuff/Catnames_MasterList_14-06-02.csv' INTO TABLE catnames FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;

Had some problems:
Query OK, 4960 rows affected, 1 warning (1.01 sec)
Records: 4983  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 23  Warnings: 1

to show warnings, enter:

SHOW WARNINGS;



WHEN LINES ARE SKIPPED - that means dups in the primary key.
Create a table without primary key, load it with same csv

CREATE TABLE catnames_noPK (
CatNav         varchar(20),
CatName_E      VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
CatName_V      VARCHAR(60) NOT NULL,
Comn_Link_Name VARCHAR(60),
Comn_Nxt_Link  INT UNSIGNED,
Spec_Labels_E  VARCHAR(700),
Spec_Labels_V  VARCHAR(700),
INDEX ( CatNav )
);

LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'D:/NTOM/DataBase Stuff/Catnames_MasterList_14-06-02.csv' INTO TABLE catnames_noPK FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES;

Then do:
   select catnav from catnames_noPK group by catnav having count(*) > 1

   to get a list of duplicates:
catnav
------sql LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE

21173
211733

Fix all, resave file.  Reload, check for dupes.

===================================================================================
14-06-03

Uploading new catnames table to OL_NTOM:

First, save the table with a mysql dump:

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom catnames > c:\NTOM_DB_14-06-03_catnamesOnly.sql

Use 7-zip to create gz file:
c:\NTOM_DB_14-06-03_catnamesOnly.sql.gz

Not sure if uploading this file as "Restore Database backup" would wipe out my entire database though,
so instead:

at Online site, EMPTY (TRUNCATE) catnames,
then paste the INSERT part of NTOM_DB_14-06-03_catnamesOnly.sql in the online SQL prompt 
- took a while to execute (upload), but it worked.

==============================================================================

Adding/Updating catnames for new categories:
On local MSQDB:

INSERT INTO catnames (CatNav,CatName_E,CatName_V,Comn_Nxt_Link) VALUES ('3L','Video Accessories','Video Accessories',0);

or  

UPDATE catnames SET CatNav = '' where CatNav='';


, '$2a$08$EHXwrgwEsyAWEnikBx0Cs.n7Ajm6yoA7E1Oco6aFW70AhVTAxQD5y' = ABC123xyz


===========================================================================
Setting auto-increment

ALTER TABLE nt_items AUTO_INCREMENT=13752;
ALTER TABLE shop_il_135 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

===========================================================================
Cleaning up after bad integration:
From XX_Imgs_Parts remove all current date/time images added
From shopNNN/ItemImgs remove all  current date/time images added
From shopNNN/ItemImgs remove all Shop_1, Prod_1, BC_ etc.

DELETE FROM shop_il_135;
ALTER TABLE shop_il_135 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;
DELETE FROM nt_items WHERE  NTParts_Ix>=13792;
ALTER TABLE nt_items AUTO_INCREMENT=13792;

==========================================================================

Adding/Updating catnames for new categories:
On local MSQDB:

INSERT INTO catnames (CatNav,CatName_E,CatName_V,Comn_Nxt_Link) VALUES ('3L','Video Accessories','Video Accessories',0);

or  

UPDATE catnames SET CatNav = '' where CatNav='';


-------------------------------------------------------------------------


==============================================================
14-06-19
Backup current DB which has fake shops 113 and 157, and NT_Items with many fake items

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-06-19-PreOnlyRealData.sql



==============================================================
To avoid entering all new shops by hand:
1) Download NTOM db from ntom.vn
2) Save Shops INSERT command, _ILs, and Bndls for new shops
3) DELETE FROM shops to wipe out existing shops
4) import the NTOM database into the new database:
(At a DOS prompt):
   mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom < C:\ntomvn_NTOM-shopsILsBndls_DLFromNTOM.vn_14-06-21.sql
5) Create new shopNNN and nickname folders

==============================================================   
Integrating Inventories:
1) use localhost/64_Admin_ImportNTPartsInfo.php
2) Move inventories to integrate to XX_ShopInventoryUploads
3) When integrating, check:
    - NT_Items before/after   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nt_items;
    - shop_il_NNN before/after  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM shop_il_;
    - monitor shopNNN folder
    
   When finished integrating:
    - search for known parts
    - login as shop, do View Inventory
    
  First integration:  S999_InvInfo_P1_14-06-19.zip
    NT_Items before:     3930    after:
    Shop_il_999 before:     0    after:
    Num XX_ImgsParts  before:  2418  after:
    
   first run in debug mode:

mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom < C:\NewACAdapatorCatNames.sql
   
   
============================================================================
14-07-16 - Clear Shop_Il's, NT_Items, upload fresh, updated shop inventories

1) First backup current dB:

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-07-16_PreFreshInvDBs.sql   

and on NTOM.vn,backup current dB, downloads as ntomvn_NTOM.gz, renamed to: 
ntomvn_NTOM_PreFreshInvDBs_14-07-16.gz 
and unpacked as
ntomvn_NTOM_PreFreshInvDBs_14-07-16.sql

2) backup images, shopSite folders, 

3) Test invImport

4) 





===================================

select NTParts_Ix,Date_Last_Mod,NT_Item_CatNav,NT_Item_PartExt,SUBSTR(Part_Name_E,1,25),SUBSTR(Part_Name_V,1,25),Manufacturer,SUBSTR(Mfr_Part_Num,1,25),Shops_List from NT_Items LIMIT 50;


==========================================
14-08-31:

Replace LOCAL dB data with online dB data (up to date Catnames, ~20 shops integrated, cleaned up carts, activity log)

mysqldump -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM ntomvn_ntom > c:\NTOM_DB_14-08-31_PreUpdateFromOLNTOM.sql   

----------------------

mysql -u root -pMSQLPW_NTOM -D ntomvn_ntom < C:\ntomvn_NTOM_14-08-31_AfterCleanup.sql
